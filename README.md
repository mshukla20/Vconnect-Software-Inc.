# Vconnect-Software-Inc.
VConnect is a mobile application to enable video conferencing with your contacts while social distancing. It has features like video calls, group gaming, and group movie viewing.
This platform fulfills the emotional need for collaboration and interaction in times of social distancing. We will, therefore, hit millions of subscribers who will sign up for this service. In the longer run, we will be adding revenue-generating features that will require in-app purchases. We are also looking at influencer collaboration and advertisement revenue.
